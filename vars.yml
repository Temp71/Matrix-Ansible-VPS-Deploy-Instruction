# The bare domain name which represents your Matrix identity.
# Matrix user IDs for your server will be of the form (`@alice:example.com`).
#
# Note: this playbook does not touch the server referenced here.
# Installation happens on another server ("matrix.example.com", see `matrix_server_fqn_matrix`).
#
# If you've deployed using the wrong domain, you'll have to run the Uninstalling step,
# because you can't change the Domain after deployment.

# See:
#  - `roles/custom/matrix-base/defaults/main.yml` for valid options
#  - the `docs/configuring-playbook-IMPLEMENTATION_NAME.md` documentation page, if one is available for your implementation choice
#
# By default, we use Synapse, because it's the only full-featured Matrix server at the moment.

# Note that the homeserver implementation of a server will not be able to be changed without data loss.

# By default, the playbook manages its own Traefik (https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) reverse-proxy server.
# It will retrieve SSL certificates for you on-demand and forward requests to all other components.

# Controls whether container networks will be created with IPv6 support.
#
# If you also have IPv6 support on your server/network and AAAA DNS records pointing to the server,
# enabling this will effectively give you full public IPv6 connectivity (powered by NAT66).
#
# We recommend leaving this enabled even if you don't currently have IPv6 connectivity on your server/network.
# This way, once you eventually get IPv6 connectivity, you won't have to change anything (besides DNS records).
#
# Flipping this setting later on requires manual work (stopping services, deleting and recreating all container networks).
#
# In the future, this setting will likely default to `true`, so if you really want IPv6 disabled, explicitly set this to `false`.
#
# People managing Docker themselves and running an older Docker version will need additional configuration.
#
# Learn more in `docs/configuring-ipv6.md`.

# A Postgres password to use for the superuser Postgres user (called `matrix` by default).
#
# The playbook creates additional Postgres users and databases (one for each enabled service) using this superuser account.
#
# Changing this value subsequently requires manual work.

# By default, we configure coturn's external IP address using the value specified for `ansible_host` in your `inventory/hosts` file.
# If this value is an external IP address, you can skip this section.
#
# If `ansible_host` is not the server's external IP address, you have 2 choices:
# 1. Uncomment the line below, to allow IP address auto-detection to happen (more on this below)
# 2. Uncomment and adjust the line below to specify an IP address manually
#
# By default, auto-detection will be attempted using the `https://ifconfig.co/json` API.
# Default values for this are specified in `matrix_coturn_turn_external_ip_address_auto_detection_*` variables in the coturn role
# (see `roles/custom/matrix-coturn/defaults/main.yml`).
#
# If your server has multiple IP addresses, you may define them in another variable which allows a list of addresses.
# Example: `matrix_coturn_turn_external_ip_addresses: ['1.2.3.4', '4.5.6.7']`
